Being a web dev aspirant, I have gained hands-on experience on frontend development when I was working on our Mini Project in my 4th semester.
Then I decided to challenge myself to do a google clone which is a minimal good looking page.
Anyhow I managed to do this in 4 hours.
Being a newbie, accomplishing this motivated me to learn more and more in the frontend development.
